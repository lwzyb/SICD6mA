
# SICDm6A

SICDm6A is a deep-learning-based tool to predict 6mA sites across species. 

# Dependency
- anaconda 5.3 
- Python 3.7
- numpy
- pytorch 1.0 
- pylab
- sklearn

** It is highly recommended to install based on anaconda £¨python 3.7£© 
** Please install cuda first if the predicted data is very large.
